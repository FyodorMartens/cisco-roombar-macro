Macro's for Cisco Roombar + Tablet. 

Mainly fixes on the already released Cisco Macro's located under https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/roomdevices-macros-samples

Target : Releasing the room when no one is attending.

This macro use the data collected by the Cisco Video Conferencing endpoints to determine if the room is really used during a meeting. When a booking start the macro starts to listen to the metrics update events.

The following metrics are used:

Active Call -> the number of calls in progress

Presence -> presence detection

People Count -> the number of people counted in the room

Sound Level -> the sound level in the room

Presentation Mode -> the presentation mode (Off / Receiving / Sending)

Requirements

The device must have a calendar enabled.

Also in the macro you have to set one of the 2 variables: const USE_PEOPLE_COUNT_ONLY OR const USE_PRESENCE_AND_COUNT to true to make it work
